Course project for CSE 232B

A failed project, used too complicated data structue, failed to make use of the
good things about visitor. If I will do it again, I will use only context as
data structure. Grouping all the nodes of one variable binding to a single
structure is the most stupid approach. Don't ever do it again.
Feel free to check out the code, if you can understand it. It is extremely hard
to understand and complicated, no one should write a parser like this, please
use it as an counter example.

The good things:
1. I actually learnt more about actual use of data structures, and how to use
interface and subclass to simplify life. I leart about not coding alone, not
staying up too long, never try to write code before writing concrete thoughts on
paper. At least, that's what I learnt. I will post the report later.
